# JetNote - A Sample Project for Jetpack Compose UI Building

JetNote is a sample project that demonstrates the use of modern Android development tools and architectures, including Jetpack Compose for UI building, ViewModel for managing UI-related data, Room for local database storage, Hilt for dependency injection, and Kotlin Coroutines with Flow for handling asynchronous data.

## Features
- **Jetpack Compose UI**: A modern, declarative way to build UIs with Kotlin.
- **ViewModel**: To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Room**: A local database for storing notes data.
- **Hilt**: A dependency injection library for easier and more modular app architecture.
- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: To handle asynchronous operations and data streams efficiently.

## Tech Stack
- **Jetpack Compose**: UI framework for building native UIs.
- **Room Database**: Persistent storage with SQLite.
- **Hilt**: Dependency injection framework.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming for cleaner code.
- **Flow**: A type for cold streams of data.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Android Studio (latest stable version)
- Kotlin (1.5+)
- Gradle (7.0+)
- Android SDK (minimum SDK 21)
